Evolving Attackers against Wireless Sensor Networks
================
# Project Overview
Recent technological improvements in wireless communication and electronics have enabled the development of small, low-cost devices, which can perform a variety of tasks. Such devices can be composed into a wireless sensor network (WSN). While routing and modelling strategies in WSNs are getting some focus from researchers, the security of this technology is not yet considered in detail. The objective of the project is to discover how genetic programming can be used to construct an attacker in a WSN and how can the defence mechanism be improved to defend against such an attack.

# Components
The project consists of the following components: 
 * The `DirDeff` folder consists of the code that is used to implement 
   WSN with directed diffusion and SNAIS
 * The `GP` folder consists of the code used to evolve the attackers 
 * The `IDSEvolution` folder consists of the code used to evolve the weights in
   SNAIS
 * The `RandomNetworkGenerator` folder consists of the code used to generate 
   random network topologies
 * The `ScaleFreeNetworkGenerator` folder consists of the code used to generate 
   scale-free network topologies
 * Other files in the main folder are used to analyse the results and 
   set-up the environment
